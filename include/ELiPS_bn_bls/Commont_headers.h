 *
 * ELiPS: Stands for Efficient Library for Pairing based Security.
 * The main goal of this library is to give the reaserchers a tool that 
 * can be easy to install, configure and use. 
 * With a basic idea of pairing-based crypto anyone can be able to use this library for their reserach of protocols.
 * We would like to update this library as incremental basis along side of our research activity to include the contemporary algorithmic improvements.
 * 
* @section Licensing
